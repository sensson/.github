# About Sensson

Sensson is a webhosting provider.

We strongly believe in the power of open source. Through Github, 
we contribute and share open source projects that can hopefully 
help you or your company reach your goals quicker.

We have made the following Puppet modules:

- [Puppet PowerDNS](https://github.com/sensson/puppet-powerdns)
- [Puppet DirectAdmin](https://github.com/sensson/puppet-directadmin)
- [Puppet CSF](https://github.com/sensson/puppet-csf)

But it doesn't stop there. Feel free to browse through our projects.

This is our way of saying thanks to the open source community.
